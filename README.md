# Building-a-Machine-Learning-Model-with-Python

In this project, I created a machine learning model using Python. This project has provided a real hands-on experience for an aspiring learner of data science and analytics trying to break into the field.

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides a machine, the ability to learn automatically from experience without being explicitly programmed. 

The following topics covered in the project.
1. Loading the dataset
2. Understanding the dataset
3. Data preprocessing
4. Data visualization
5. Building a regression model
6. Model evaluation
7. Model prediction
